List of things to add to lambda:


1) decouple the lambda for efficiency. 2 lambda functions. One for update and one to call the update function. This will mean that I will call any number of updates based on the orchestration and will speed up updating. 
2) I need to fix the problem of overgeared.
3) add function to add any chapter of any novel in past. 



Front End:
1) start with making the play button better in mobile.
2) make the front end more like a streaming web app.
